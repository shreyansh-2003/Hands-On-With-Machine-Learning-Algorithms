># Method / Approach
1. Data Collection: Gather relevant customer data, including demographics, purchase history, browsing behavior, and any other available information. (Already Done)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations or feature engineering.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct an initial exploration of the data to gain insights and understand its distribution, correlations, and outliers.
4. K-means Clustering: Apply the K-means algorithm to group customers based on their features or behaviors. Experiment with different numbers of clusters.
5. Silhouette Analysis: Evaluate the quality of the clustering results using Silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
6. Elbow Method: Use the Elbow method to validate the number of clusters and strike a balance between granularity and interpretability.
7. Random Forest Classification: Employ Random Forest to classify customers into different segments based on the identified features. Analyze the importance of features in segment differentiation.
8. Evaluation and Validation: Assess the validity and reliability of the customer segmentation through measures such as silhouette scores and predictive performance.
9. Insights and Recommendations: Derive actionable insights from the customer segmentation results and provide recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
