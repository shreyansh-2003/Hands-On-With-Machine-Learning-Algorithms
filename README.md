# Hands On With Machine Learning Algorithms

---

---

># Overview
This repository contains a collection of labs that explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques. Each lab focuses on a specific topic and provides detailed explanations, code examples, and analysis. The labs cover clustering, classification and regression algos, hyperparameter tuning, data-preprocessing and various evaluation metrics.

__Coverage__
- The algorithms covered within the repository are Linear Regression OLS, Linear Regression with Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machines), KMeans Clustering, Hierarchichal Clustering (AGNES).
- The labs also cover various feature engineering, scaling, generating and encoding techniques that help in getting the data prepared for ML solutions.
- Most Labs also include manual Hyperparameter Tuning (not GridSearchCV), as it helps in better understanding the optimal parameters and their workaround.

- All Lab Directories have these files:
  1. ```main_notebook.ipynb``` that are jupyter notebooks for those particular labs and contain all the relevant code and its outputs, with detailed line-by line comments.
  2. ```pdf_notebook.pdf``` that are pdf versions of the jupyter notebook
  3. ```README.md``` are detailed markdowns, containing an introduction, tasks, methods, results and observations in-line with the labs.
  4. Additional ```excel```,```csv```,```pickled``` files w.r.t. the lab.
