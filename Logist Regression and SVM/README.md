> # Introduction

The notebook in the directory delves into the fascinating world of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Regression (LR) in the context of classification. SVMs and LR are widely used machine learning algorithms that play a crucial role in various domains, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, and image classification. In this notebook, we explore these algorithms' capabilities and compare their suitability for classification tasks using two carefully crafted datasets. These datasets are designed to have more than 50% informative features and a minimum of 2500 rows, ensuring their complexity and representativeness. Additionally, we apply feature scaling techniques to enhance the models' performance, and meticulously evaluate the impact of these transformations on the final classification results. The notebook provides a comprehensive and structured analysis, presenting our findings and insights in a clear and concise manner, enabling readers to gain a deeper understanding of SVMs, LR, and their applicability in classification tasks.
